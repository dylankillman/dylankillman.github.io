    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

        <p>
            Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, along with developing this ePortfolio, has been quite a journey for me. Throughout the program, I’ve had the opportunity to grow not only my technical skills, but also my confidence and focus. The coursework and hands-on projects that I worked on during this program have helped me refine my abilities and define my professional goals more clearly. Revisiting projects I completed earlier in the program and enhancing them with the knowledge and skills I gained later on in the program gave me a valuable opportunity to demonstrate my understanding of core computer science principles, including software and UI design, data structures, and databases.
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout the program, I’ve learned the value of collaboration in development environments, and I’ve been able to apply that every day at work as well. There were a couple of team-based assignments throughout the program, and these allowed me to learn how to contribute meaningfully within a group, communicate my ideas clearly, and support others via peer review and positive or negative feedback. I also often had peers review my code and projects, even when they weren’t developed in a group environment, in order to further foster my collaborative skills. These experiences prepared me to work in teams and communicate effectively with both technical partners, along with non-technical stakeholders like a customer for whom I’m developing a product. I’ve also honed my skills in creating documentation for my products, along with clear, maintainable code with clear comments to improve readability and allow for other professionals to easily update and modify my code.
        </p>

        <p>
            My work with data structures and algorithms in this program deeply improved my problem-solving skills and allowed me to create more efficient solutions to problems. For example, in my data structures enhancement, I redesigned my CS-300 Course Planner product to utilize a binary search tree instead of a vector for data storage and traversal. This not only improved the execution time but also demonstrated my ability to analyze trade-offs when it comes to design decisions—balancing performance, efficiency, and maintainability. This is vital when it comes to building scalable products.
        </p>

        <p>
            The software engineering and database-focused courses helped solidify my understanding of the software development process from start to finish. I learned how to apply object-oriented principles to the software development lifecycle and combine that with the use of tools and frameworks to create efficient and modular products. In one of the enhancements for this capstone, I completely refactored a mobile application to align with more modern UI design practices and improve the usability and visual appeal. In another artifact, I improved a MongoDB-based dashboard product by adding indexing, aggregation pipelines, and bulk insertion techniques, which improved both usability and overall performance.
        </p>

        <p>
            Security was also a big part of this program. Because of this, I’ve been able to develop a mindset that anticipates vulnerabilities and incorporates proactive measures instead of standing back and reacting when a security breach or incident might happen. I’ve learned about and applied secure coding practices from the requirements phase all the way through development and rollout of the product. These practices include validating user input, applying the principle of least privilege, and understanding the risks of generally non-secure practices like unsafe data handling. Even though security wasn’t the central focus of all artifacts, I still approach every project paying special attention to security.
        </p>

        <p>
            Altogether, I feel that the enhancements that are included in this portfolio represent a full picture of my skills and growth as a developer throughout this program. Each artifact highlights different strengths—software engineering through user-centric designs, data optimization through more efficient data structures, and database fluency through performance tuning. These not only demonstrate my technical proficiency but also my ability to communicate and present my work in a coherent, professional manner.

        <h3 style="margin-top: 60px;">Enhancement Narrative</h3>

        <p>
            The artifact that I selected for this category is my mobile Android application, which I named Fit Goals. This was originally developed in my CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming class. The app’s purpose is to give users a simple platform that allows them to track their daily weight and set a goal weight. It includes features like login and registration, a dashboard now with data visualization, SMS notification toggling, and the ability to edit and add weight entries. The original version was functional but was very basic in its style and design, making it feel like an app that wouldn’t realistically be taken to market.
        </p>

        <p>
            I chose this artifact for a couple of reasons. First, it’s one of the most recent projects that I’ve done, having completed this one just last term, so the memory was still fresh in my head. Second, and more importantly, I think it provided a solid opportunity for me to demonstrate improvement in software design and engineering. The original app had a strong backend foundation, but the frontend was completely lacking in its visual aspects. By enhancing the design and UI, I was able to show my skills in Android UI design and UX best practices, along with smaller things like theme and color consistency. Some of the specific enhancements made included applying a custom gradient background across all the app’s activities to give a consistent, visually appealing theme. I also updated all the buttons and input fields with more modern styles. I also replaced the ugly orange and purple UI elements with a cohesive blue theme that matches the gradient. Finally, the big functional enhancement is the addition of the line graph on the dashboard. The original app displayed the daily weights in a grid format. I replaced that with a visual line graph that shows the user their progress in a more visually appealing form. All of these not only show my abilities in Android software development but also shows my ability to improve an application’s usability and accessibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            The outcome I planned to meet with this enhancement from Module One was Course Outcome #4 (Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals (software engineering/design/database). I definitely believe that I fully met this outcome by improving this app’s design for real-world usability and adding a visually appealing data visualization component. Also, the integration of the MPAndroidChart library shows my ability to use external tools and frameworks within a project. I don’t currently have any updates to my outcome-coverage plan at this time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Trying to enhance and modernize this app taught me a lot about how important it is to really think about design and intuitiveness when it comes to applications. It was especially rewarding to implement the line chart. It required me to transform weight data into entries that are able to be plotted on a graph. I also styled the graph to match the application’s overall theme. I also added labels, axes, and a description that tells the user that if they lost weight, the line will be green, and if they’ve gained weight, the line will be red. These skills are obviously relevant to any modern app involving data like this. One of the biggest challenges that I faced was trying to get a consistent look and style across all the pages. You would think that just copying and pasting theme code would work, but it didn’t quite work like that. Another challenge was integrating the chart while not losing performance and ensuring that the chart would update whenever a new weight was added.

    <!-- Enhancement Two -->
    <section id="enhancement-two">
        <h2>Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
        <p>
            This enhancement demonstrates optimization in algorithmic efficiency and use of structured data through
            the redesign of my Course Planner project originally developed in CS-300. By transitioning from a simple
            vector to a binary search tree (BST), the enhancement significantly improved search performance across
            both small and large datasets.

        <h3 style="margin-top: 60px;">Enhancement Narrative</h3>
      
        <p>
            The artifact that I selected for this category is my final project, the Course Planner program, from CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms class, which was originally created in the spring of 2024. The program is relatively simple; it’s a command-line-driven course planner application written in C++. Users can load a list of courses from a .csv file, display the full list of courses in alphanumeric order, or search for specific details about any course, including any prerequisites required for that course. I’ve also added a feature that displays the time it took for any process to complete in microseconds. The original version of this program, which I submitted when I took CS-300, used a vector to store the course information and utilized the sort() function from the standard library to alphabetize the data every time it was requested.
        </p>

        <p>
            I chose this artifact because it’s a relatively clean, simple, yet functional example of working with data structures. I figured the best artifact for the Data Structures and Algorithms category was the final project from the Data Structures and Algorithms class. I immediately thought of this artifact because I remember that back when I originally created the program, I purposely chose to use a vector because it was simpler to code, and I didn’t really have a fantastic grasp on data structures back then. This enhancement required completely overhauling the program, including designing and implementing a new CourseNode structure, coding recursive Binary Search Tree (BST) operations, and replacing all of the sorting and searching code with a BST-based traversal. Also, I added the timing functionality using the chrono library in order to showcase the performance difference between the vector and BST versions of the program. I believe these enhancements demonstrate my ability to employ algorithmic thinking, analyze performance differences, and assess and apply trade-offs between different concepts, specifically between various data structures. I also created a larger dataset with 1000 entries, instead of the original dataset's eight entries, so that the performance improvements could be measured and observed. With this, the BST provided a significant improvement in performance, showing that as the dataset gets larger, the algorithm becomes more efficient.
        </p>

        <p>
            I originally planned to meet Course Outcome #3 (designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles while managing trade-offs) and Course Outcome #4 (demonstrating techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices), and I believe that I fully met both of these. For Course Outcome #3, I analyzed the existing vector-based solution and saw that as the datasets get larger, the mechanism becomes slower and less efficient because of the very nature of vectors, and found a better solution to the problem. For Course Outcome #4, I applied data structure design principles and algorithms to create a functional BST-based program instead of an inefficient vector-based program, which demonstrates my understanding of tools and techniques to solve real-world computing problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            During this enhancement, I improved my understanding of both algorithmic design and data structures. Even though the BST may be a little more complex and harder to implement and write code for, I think the advantages and trade-offs are worth it, especially when you start working with large datasets. One of the most educational parts of this enhancement was working through the process of implementing and measuring time. I had to choose microseconds because if the time were in seconds, the difference in performance wouldn’t be measurable. I learned that this strategy can and should be employed in almost everything I do that’s code-related. It’s very valuable to write something one way, test it, and then write it a different way and test it and measure the difference in order to select the most efficient thing. One challenge that I faced during this enhancement was the BST implementation itself. I was never really great with BSTs when I took the original class, so at first, this was a tall task for me and my current skills. Getting the search time down to O(log n) from O(n) seemed like a foreign language to me at first. And using insertion instead of push_back wasn’t something that I had a lot of practice with.

    <!-- Enhancement Three -->
    <section id="enhancement-three">
        <h2>Enhancement Three: Databases</h2>
        <p>
            This enhancement builds upon my MongoDB-based animal shelter dashboard project originally developed in CS-340. 
            I applied three key database-focused improvements: (1) adding <strong>indexes</strong> to optimize query speed, 
            (2) using <strong>aggregation pipelines</strong> to extract and visualize data trends, and 
            (3) implementing <strong>bulk insertion</strong> to improve data ingestion performance. 
            These changes improved efficiency, analytical insight, and usability.

      <h3 style="margin-top: 60px;">Enhancement Narrative</h3>

        <p>
            The artifact that I selected for the Databases enhancement is a Python-based MongoDB dashboard that I created for my final project in the CS-340: Client/Server Development course. It was originally developed in a virtual Apporto environment and utilizes the Dash framework to give CRUD functionality and data visualization of data for a local animal shelter in Austin, Texas. It has a dashboard, geolocation maps, interactive charts, and radio button filters enabling the user to sort and view data based on desired criteria like breed, purpose, age, etc.. The original product had very basic CRUD functions but lacked efficiency.
        </p>

        <p>
            I chose this artifact because I thought it fit perfectly within the Databases category, considering that MongoDB and CRUD operations are the entire focus of the artifact. It offered a good opportunity to demonstrate some practice database concepts. I think the enhancements I made really showed my ability to apply database solutions. The artifact was improved in several ways. First, I implemented indexing on key fields like animal type, breed, and age in order to reduce query execution times. Before applying indexing, queries would take a little longer to run, but with indexes applied, the same query (over 2,600 results) returned in 22 milliseconds. I also implemented an aggregation pipeline. I incorporated this into the overall dashboard product as well. I used MongoDB’s aggregation framework to group and count dog adoptions that were under two years of age by breed. I used this specific criterion, but this same concept can be applied to any desired combination of fields. Finally, I added a function for bulk insertions. I added an insert_many() method to allow the system to more efficiently insert large datasets, specifically from CSV files. I also created a mock bulk animals CSV file to demonstrate that data could be successfully inserted in bulk. All of these make the product more scalable, efficient, and practical.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think these enhancements align well with Course Outcome #3 and Course Outcome #4. The indexing and aggregation features directly address product optimization, while the bulk insertion enhancement is vital for the scalability of the product and shows that I could implement an innovative technique to deliver value.
        </p>

        <p>
            This artifact was by far the most difficult to enhance. However, I did learn a lot more about MongoDB’s tools and how it works. One of the challenges I faced was trying to verify that I could delete the records that were inserted in bulk. To do this, I ended up checking both Boolean and String “True” values and making sure I got a response that the number of records deleted matched the number of records that were originally added. The other huge challenge I faced was with the aggregation enhancement. I wanted to not only test it in its own cell (which I did), but I wanted to figure out a way to incorporate it into the overall dashboard product. I ended up creating its own radio button and working through the little kinks that came along. Overall, these enhancements made me a better developer and have increased my overall confidence in developing and optimizing products.
