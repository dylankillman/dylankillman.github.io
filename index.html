        <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
        <p>
            Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University and developing this ePortfolio has been a transformative experience. Through the structured curriculum and hands-on project work, I have been able to sharpen my technical capabilities, define my career goals, and cultivate a professional identity in the field of computer science. The process of enhancing legacy projects across the categories of software design, algorithms, and databases has provided me with an opportunity to demonstrate growth, apply industry-standard best practices, and create work I am truly proud to showcase.
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout the program, I developed skills that are highly relevant to today’s software development landscape. In particular, my ability to work in <strong>collaborative team environments</strong> was strengthened through discussion-based courses, code review assignments, and peer feedback. I’ve become adept at <strong>communicating with technical and non-technical stakeholders</strong>, articulating the value of my code in clear, goal-oriented language. I’ve also refined my proficiency with <strong>data structures and algorithms</strong>—a strength I demonstrated through transitioning a project from a simple vector to a binary search tree, resulting in significantly faster search operations.
        </p>

        <p>
            My experience in <strong>software engineering</strong> is reflected in the rebranding and UI/UX overhaul of my mobile weight tracking app, where I focused on usability, visual consistency, and user experience. Similarly, in the <strong>database domain</strong>, I implemented aggregation pipelines, indexing, and bulk insertion features in a MongoDB-based animal shelter dashboard project. These enhancements showcased my ability to think critically about data processing, system performance, and analytical presentation.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to technical knowledge, I’ve adopted a <strong>security-first mindset</strong>, ensuring my solutions are not only functional but also mindful of data integrity, privacy, and risk mitigation. For example, my approach to database enhancements included safe input handling and the use of indexing not just for speed, but also to reduce unnecessary query overhead and surface exposure.
        </p>

        <p>
            The artifacts I’ve chosen for this ePortfolio—spanning mobile application development, data structure optimization, and database engineering—together present a well-rounded picture of my technical competencies and problem-solving abilities. They are concrete evidence of my readiness for real-world software development roles and illustrate my evolution as a developer capable of building scalable, secure, and user-focused systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I transition into the professional world, I plan to pursue opportunities in full-stack development or systems architecture where I can continue building impactful solutions. This ePortfolio represents not only what I’ve achieved in the program, but the foundation for a career built on innovation, adaptability, and continuous improvement.

        <h2>Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</h2>
        <p>
            This enhancement showcases the original and improved versions of my Weight Tracker app from CS-360,
            now rebranded as <strong>FitGoals</strong>. The changes emphasize consistent UI/UX, visual design,
            and usability improvements.

    <section id="enhancement-two">
        <h2>Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
        <p>
            This enhancement demonstrates optimization in algorithmic efficiency and use of structured data through
            the redesign of my Course Planner project originally developed in CS-300. By transitioning from a simple
            vector to a binary search tree (BST), the enhancement significantly improved search performance across
            both small and large datasets.

    <!-- Enhancement Three -->
    <section id="enhancement-three">
        <h2>Enhancement Three: Databases</h2>
        <p>
            This enhancement builds upon my MongoDB-based animal shelter dashboard project originally developed in CS-340. 
            I applied three key database-focused improvements: (1) adding <strong>indexes</strong> to optimize query speed, 
            (2) using <strong>aggregation pipelines</strong> to extract and visualize data trends, and 
            (3) implementing <strong>bulk insertion</strong> to improve data ingestion performance. 
            These changes improved efficiency, analytical insight, and usability.
